**Following is the benchmark from `dbperf` suite to thrash DB algorithms.**

* Initial load 1 Million items.
* Then the suite starts with 9 routines.
* one routine does:
  * 1 Million random inserts
  * 1 Million random updates.
  * 1 Million random deletes.
* 4 routine does 10 Million random Get operation each.
* 4 routine does 10 Million random Range operation each.
  Each range operation iterates over 100 key,value entry.

**On MacBookPro 15-inch i7, 4/8 cores, 16GB RAM**.
